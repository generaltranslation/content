General Translation accounts are structured around **Organizations** and optionally **Enterprises**.

**Organizations** contain your projects and team members. Most users work within a single organization.

**Enterprises** are an optional layer above organizations for managing multiple organizations with centralized member management. If you're not part of an enterprise, those sections won't appear in your sidebar.

## Members

The Members page shows everyone with access to your organization.

### Roles

- **Owner**: Full access to all settings and member management. Can delete the organization or transfer ownership to another member.
- **Admin**: Can manage projects, members, and most settings.
- **Member**: Can view and edit translations, but limited settings access.

### Inviting members

Organization owners and admins can invite new members by email. Invitees receive a link to join the organization. The link expires after 24 hours.

For enterprise accounts, members added at the enterprise level can access all managed organizations.

## Organization settings

- **Organization name**: Update your org's display name
- **Default settings**: Configure defaults for new projects
