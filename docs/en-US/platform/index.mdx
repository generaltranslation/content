The General Translation dashboard is where you review and edit translations, configure AI context, and sync changes back to your codebase.

## Navigation

The dashboard is scoped by **Enterprise**, **Organization**, and **Project**. Use the breadcrumb switcher in the top header to move between them.

The sidebar updates based on your current scope:

- **Project scope**: Overview, Locadex, Translations, AI Context, API Keys, Settings
- **Organization scope**: Members, Usage, Billing, Upgrade, Settings
- **Enterprise scope** (if applicable): Members, Organizations, Billing, Settings

If you're not part of an enterprise, those sections won't appear.


## Key sections

### Translations

The Translations page is where you browse files, view source and translated content side-by-side, edit translations, and trigger retranslations.

See [Translations](/docs/platform/translations) for the full guide.

### AI context

AI Context controls the tone, terminology, and cultural nuances of your translations. It has three parts: Style Controls (author, audience, tone), Glossary (consistent terminology), and Locale Context (per-language guidance).

See [AI Context](/docs/platform/ai-context/style-controls) for details.

### Locadex

Locadex is the agent that syncs your translation edits back to your GitHub repository. It can run manually or automatically when it detects changes.

See the [Locadex docs](/docs/locadex) for setup and usage.

### Projects and API keys

Project settings control publishing options, repository connections, and API keys for authenticating with GT services.

See [Project Settings](/docs/platform/projects/settings) for configuration details. See [API Keys](/docs/platform/projects/api-keys) for managing API keys.
