The Translations page is where you manage all translated content for your project. Browse files, view translations alongside source content, and edit them directly.

## Browsing files

When you open Translations, you'll see a file tree on the left showing all translatable content in your project.

- **Expand folders** to navigate your project structure
- **Search** to filter files by name
- **File count** shows total files in the current branch

Select a file to view its content.

### Branch and version

Use the **Branch** selector at the top to switch between branches in your repository. Some files also have a **Version** selector to view older versions of the translation.

## Viewing translations

Once you select a file, you'll see the translated content in the main panel.

- **Locale selector**: Switch between target languages (Spanish, French, Chinese, etc.)
- **Source toggle**: View the original source content alongside the translation

The viewer renders markdown content with proper formatting, so you can see exactly how headings, lists, and other markup will appear.

## Editing translations

Click **Edit** on any file to modify the translation content. The editor opens as a modal with two panels:

## Components view

For projects using JSX or component-based content (like React apps), the Translations page shows a **Components** view instead of a file tree.

Components are listed with:
- **Hash ID**: Unique identifier for the component
- **Content preview**: The translatable text

You can search for any component by its source text or ID. Click a component to view and edit its translations.
