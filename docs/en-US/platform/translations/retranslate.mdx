title: Retranslating Content
description: Regenerate translations with updated source or context
---

Use **Retranslate** when you need to regenerate a translation. This is useful when:

- Source content has changed
- You've updated [AI Context](/docs/platform/ai-context/style-controls) (style, glossary, or locale settings)
- You want the AI to take another pass at the translation

## How retranslation works

1. Click the **Retranslate** button on a file
2. The button shows a spinner while the job runs
3. A toast notification appears when complete
4. The view updates with the new translation

Retranslation happens in the background. You can navigate away—when you return, the job will continue and the content will update when finished.

## Syncing retranslations to your repo

After retranslating, a banner appears showing how many files have pending changes. Click **Run Agent** to open Locadex and sync everything back to your repository.

If you're retranslating multiple files, wait until you're done, then run the agent once to create a single PR with all changes.

## Tips

- **Update AI Context first** if you're retranslating—the new context will apply to all regenerated content
- **Check the branch** if you're not seeing expected changes
- **Batch retranslations** before running Locadex to keep your PR history clean
