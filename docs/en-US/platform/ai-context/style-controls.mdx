title: Style Controls
description: Set the overall tone and context for your project
---

The AI Context page has three tabs: Style Controls, [Glossary](/docs/platform/ai-context/glossary), and [Locale Context](/docs/platform/ai-context/locale-context).

Style Controls define the overall tone and context for your project. These settings apply to all translations across every locale in your project.

## Fields

- **Author**: Who is creating this content (your company or team name)
- **Target Audience**: Who will read this content (developers, end users, enterprise customers, etc.)
- **Project Description**: What your product does—helps the AI understand domain context
- **Tone and Style**: How translations should sound (professional, casual, technical, friendly, etc.)

## Writing effective style guidance

Be specific and direct:

```
Good: "Professional and concise. Use active voice. Avoid jargon unless defined in the glossary."

Too vague: "Make it sound nice."
```

Include preferences:
- Words to prefer or avoid
- Level of formality
- Whether to use contractions
- Technical depth appropriate for your audience

## How AI Context affects translations

AI Context is applied whenever the AI generates a translation:

1. **Initial translation**: When content is first translated
2. **Retranslation**: When you regenerate a translation from the Translations page
3. **Automatic updates**: When Locadex processes new content

Changes to AI Context don't automatically update existing translations. To apply new context, [retranslate](/docs/platform/translations/retranslate) the files that should use the updated settings.
