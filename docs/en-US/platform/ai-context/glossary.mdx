description: Define terms that must stay consistent across translations
---

The Glossary defines terms that must stay consistent across all translations. This is critical for product names, features, and domain-specific terminology.

## When to use the glossary

- **Product names**: "Locadex" should never be translated
- **Feature names**: "AI Context" should remain consistent
- **Technical terms**: Define how "API", "webhook", or "deployment" should appear in each language
- **Brand terms**: Ensure taglines or branded phrases translate correctly

## Adding terms

1. Click **Add Term**
2. Enter the term as it appears in your source content
3. Add a definition explaining what it means (this helps the AI understand context)
4. Optionally add specific translations for each locale

## Managing terms

- **Search**: Find existing terms quickly
- **Edit**: Update definitions or translations
- **Per-locale translations**: Override how a term appears in specific languages

## Example glossary entries

| Term | Definition | Translation (es) |
|------|-----------|------------------|
| API | Application Programming Interface | API |
| AI assistant | The conversational help feature | Asistente de IA |
| deploy | Release code to a production or staging environment | desplegar |

## Uploading context via CSV

Click **Upload Context CSV** to bulk-import glossary terms and other context fields. The system automatically detects the fields in your CSV and populates the appropriate sections—glossary terms, style controls, or locale context.

This is useful for:
- Migrating an existing glossary or style guide
- Syncing context across multiple projects
- Adding many terms at once when onboarding a new project

## Tips

- **Add terms early**: Consistency is easier to maintain than to fix later
- **Include definitions**: Helps the AI understand context even when you don't provide explicit translations
- **Review periodically**: Update entries when you introduce new product terms or notice inconsistent translations
