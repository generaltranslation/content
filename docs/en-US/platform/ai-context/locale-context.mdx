title: Locale Context
description: Provide language-specific cultural and linguistic guidance
---

Locale Context provides locale-specific guidance to the AI translator. Use this when different languages need different cultural approaches or linguistic preferences.

## When to use locale context

- **Formality levels**: German may need formal "Sie" while Spanish uses informal "tú"
- **Cultural references**: Adapt examples or idioms for the target culture
- **Date/number formats**: Specify regional preferences
- **Terminology choices**: Some languages have multiple valid translations for a term

<Callout type="info">
Locale Context only applies to the target locale you select. For guidance across all locales, use [Style Controls](/docs/platform/ai-context/style-controls) and [Glossary](/docs/platform/ai-context/glossary).
</Callout>

## Setting locale context

1. Select a target locale from the dropdown
2. Enter instructions specific to that language
3. Save your changes

These instructions are applied in addition to your [Style Controls](/docs/platform/ai-context/style-controls) when translating into that language.

## Example locale instructions

**For German (de)**:
```
Use formal "Sie" form. Maintain compound nouns rather than splitting them.
```

**For Spanish (es)**:
```
Use Latin American Spanish conventions. Prefer "computadora" over "ordenador".
```

**For Japanese (ja)**:
```
Use polite form (です/ます). Keep English product names in katakana.
```

## Tips

- **Use sparingly**: Only add language-specific instructions when the default behavior isn't right
- **Be specific**: Vague instructions like "be natural" don't help—specify exactly what you want
- **Test changes**: [Retranslate](/docs/platform/translations/retranslate) a sample file after updating to verify results
