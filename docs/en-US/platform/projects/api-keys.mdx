API keys authenticate your application with GT services. You'll find the API Keys page in the project sidebar.

## Production keys

Production API keys are 72-character strings starting with `gtx-api-`. Use these in your deployed application.

### Creating a production key

1. Click **Create API Key**
2. Enter a name for the key (e.g., "Production", "Web App")
3. Copy the full key immediately—you won't be able to see it again
4. Store it securely (environment variables, secrets manager, etc.)

### Managing keys

- **Preview**: Shows a truncated version of the key for identification
- **Created At**: When the key was generated
- **Last Used**: When the key was last used (helps identify stale keys)
- **Delete**: Revoke a key you no longer need

## Development keys

Development keys are for local development and preview environments. They start with `gtx-dev-` and should never be used in production.

| | Production | Development |
|---|-----------|-------------|
| Prefix | `gtx-api-` | `gtx-dev-` |
| Use case | Deployed apps | Local dev, previews |
| Translations | Published content | Preview translations |

Development keys let you test translations before they're published, without affecting your live application.

## Security best practices

- **Never commit keys to source control**—use environment variables
- **Rotate keys periodically**—delete old keys and create new ones
- **Use descriptive names**—makes it easier to identify and manage keys
- **Revoke unused keys**—if a key hasn't been used in months, delete it
- **Separate environments**—use different keys for staging and production
