Each project in General Translation represents a single repository or product. The Project Overview page in the dashboard shows your Project ID, current locales, and repository status. Use Settings to configure how your project behaves.

## Project details

- **Project Name**: Display name for the project
- **Project ID**: Unique identifier used in API calls and configuration (read-only, can be copied)

## Publishing

Control how translations are delivered to your application:

- **CDN**: Enable to serve translations via CDN for faster loading
- **Human Review**: Require manual approval before translations go live
- **AI Context**: Automatically infer author, audience, and tone from your project

## Repository connection

Connect your GitHub repository to enable [Locadex](/docs/locadex):

- **Connected to**: Shows the linked repository
- **Repository ID**: Internal identifier for the connection
- **Disconnect**: Remove the repository connection

To connect a new repository, you'll authenticate with GitHub and select the repo you want to link.

## Danger zone

Destructive actions like deleting the project. Use with caution.
