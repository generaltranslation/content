### What happens if there are missing translations in production?

If a translation for some content is missing in production, gt-react-native automatically falls back to the original source text. Your app will still render correctly — users will just see the default language for that piece of content.

### Why do I have to install the CLI tool?

The CLI tool parses the content inside all `<T>` components and generates translations for that content in advance, so that all the translations are ready when your app is deployed to production.

In development, you don't need it because you can use development API keys to translate on demand.

### Where does the `<T>` component get its translations?

`<T>` can load translations from anywhere depending on how you've configured the library:
- If you have a project ID, the library can hit a free CDN
- It can store translations locally in your bundle
- It can do a mix of the two

See the [loadTranslations docs](/docs/react-native/api/config/load-translations) for more details.

During development, the `<T>` component hits an API which uses a small AI model to create temporary translations so you can see them hot-reload as you write. These translations aren't stored anywhere — they're just served back to the app.

In production, `<T>` won't do this, so your API keys are never exposed to the client.

### Does AI translation work with dynamic content and variables?

The `<T>` component doesn't support translating dynamic content and variables directly, because the translations could potentially change with every re-render. However, you can still include dynamic content inside a `<T>` by wrapping it with `<Var>`, `<Datetime>`, or `<Currency>` components. This is similar to how other libraries handle string interpolation.

### Can I deploy my app without depending on GT servers?

Yes. You can do the translations yourself, then load them from your own bundle or your own CDN. See the [loadTranslations docs](/docs/react-native/api/config/load-translations) for details on loading translations from local files.
