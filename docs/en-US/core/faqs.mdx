---

### What is the core library for?

The `generaltranslation` package provides locale utilities (parsing, comparing, formatting) and direct access to the GT translation API. It's the foundation that powers gt-next, gt-react, and gt-react-native under the hood.

### Can I use the core library on its own?

Yes. If you need locale utilities like [`getLocaleName`](/docs/core/functions/locales/get-locale-name), [`isValidLocale`](/docs/core/functions/locales/is-valid-locale), or [`formatDateTime`](/docs/core/functions/formatting/format-date-time) without a React framework, you can use the core library directly.

### Do I need an API key for locale utilities?

No. Locale utility functions work entirely offline. You only need an API key if you're calling the [translation methods](/docs/core/class/methods/translation/translate) on the GT class.

### What's the difference between the standalone functions and the class methods?

The standalone functions (e.g., `getLocaleName()`) are stateless utilities you can import and call directly. The `GT` class wraps the same functionality plus translation API access, configured with your API key and project ID.
