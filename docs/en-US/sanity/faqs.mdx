### Which version of Sanity does the plugin support?

The `gt-sanity` plugin requires Sanity Studio v3 or later.

### Can I translate individual documents or only the entire site?

Both. You can translate individual documents one at a time, or use batch operations to translate multiple documents or your entire site at once. You can also selectively import translations by locale.

### How does the plugin handle Portable Text?

Documents are serialized to HTML for translation, preserving structure and metadata. Portable Text, nested objects, arrays, and custom schema types are all supported. You can also provide [custom serializers](/docs/sanity/guides/serialization) to control how specific field types are handled.

### Do translations overwrite my existing content?

No. Translated content is stored in separate translated documents, not in your source documents. You can review, edit, and manage translations independently.
