### What is Locadex?

Locadex is an AI agent that automates internationalization and translation for your project. Once installed, it monitors your repository and keeps translations up to date as your code changes.

### How does Locadex integrate with my workflow?

Locadex connects to your GitHub repository and can run automatically when it detects changes, or manually from the dashboard. It opens pull requests with translation updates that you can review before merging.

### Does Locadex work with monorepos?

Yes. See the [monorepos guide](/docs/locadex/monorepos) for configuration details.

### What frameworks does Locadex support?

Locadex currently has guides for [Next.js](/docs/locadex/next) and [Mintlify](/docs/locadex/mintlify). It can also work with other setups that use the GT CLI.

### Can I control which translations Locadex updates?

Yes. You can configure Locadex through your project settings on the dashboard and use [auto-merge](/docs/locadex/auto-merge) settings to control how translation PRs are handled.
