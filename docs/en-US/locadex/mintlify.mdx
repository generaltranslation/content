**Locadex is an AI agent built to handle 100% of internationalization (i18n) and translation work for you.**

It takes 5 minutes to install, after which your Mintlify docs will be configured and translated into all the languages you choose automatically.

Locadex:

- Sets up i18n routing and redirects in your docs
- Translates markdown files, code blocks, and snippets in context
- Continuously translates as you push new content

### Step 1: Sign into the General Translation Dashboard

Sign into the General Translation [Dashboard](https://dash.generaltranslation.com).

You'll be redirected to GitHub to authorize the connection.

- **Default locale**: The language you originally wrote the docs in

### Step 7: Review the PR

Locadex will create a pull request on your main branch. This may take a few minutes to complete.

Review the PR and merge it to complete your i18n setup.

### Step 8: Continuous internationalization

After the initial setup PR is merged, Locadex monitors your main branch for commits and updates translations as needed.

### Supported frameworks

Currently, Locadex only supports Mintlify and [Next.js App router](/docs/locadex) apps.

### Troubleshooting

When you have Locadex installed across multiple GitHub accounts or organizations, the dashboard will display a list of all of the accounts and organizations.
Connecting to an account or organization will link that account to your current GT org.
