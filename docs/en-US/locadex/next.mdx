title: Locadex for Next.js App Router
description: Automate translation for your Next.js app
---

Translating your Next.js app into French 🇫🇷, Spanish 🇪🇸, Japanese 🇯🇵, or any other language is painful and time-consuming.

**Locadex is an AI agent built to handle 100% of the internationalization (i18n) work for you.**
It takes 5 minutes to install.

{/* ![Installation screen for Locadex](/screenshots/locadex-install.png) */}

Locadex:

- Configures your project to use the gt-next i18n library
- Modifies your React components and strings to support multilingual content
- Translates your app into as many languages as you need
- Continuously internationalizes and translates as you push new content

### Step 1: Sign into the General Translation Dashboard

Go to your [Dashboard](https://dash.generaltranslation.com) and sign in to your account.

### Step 2: Connect GitHub

1. Navigate to the GitHub integration section in your dashboard
2. Click "Connect GitHub" to link your GitHub account
3. You'll be redirected to GitHub to authorize the connection

### Step 3: Install the GitHub app

1. After connecting GitHub, you'll be redirected to install the Locadex GitHub app
2. Choose which repositories to give Locadex access to:
   - Install on all repositories, or
   - Select specific repositories
3. Click "Install" to complete the GitHub app installation

### Step 4: Link repository to project

1. Back in your GT dashboard, select the repository you want to internationalize
2. This connects your repo to your translation settings and target languages
3. Only one repository can be linked to a project, but you can create multiple projects, each with a different repository

### Step 5: Configure settings

On the configuration screen, set up:

- **Target Languages**: Choose which locales to translate into

### Step 6: Complete installation

1. Review your configuration settings
2. Click "Install" to activate Locadex for your repository
3. You'll be taken to an overview page showing your connected GitHub repository

## What happens next?

### Initial setup

Once you complete the installation:

1. **Immediate PR Creation**: Locadex will create a pull request on your main branch
2. **Full Setup**: This PR runs the complete Locadex setup command that:
   - Installs the GT libraries
   - Configures your project for internationalization
   - Sets up the translation infrastructure
3. **Review & Merge**: Review the PR and merge it to complete your i18n setup

### Continuous internationalization

After the initial setup is merged:

1. Locadex monitors your main or specified branch for pull requests
2. When you push new code with translatable content, wait for Locadex to add its commit to the PR
3. Once Locadex commits to the PR, it is safe to merge -- your new code is internationalized
4. Your app stays translated without manual intervention
