title: Save Local Edits
description: How to save edits made to local translation files
---

## Usage

```bash
npx gtx-cli save-local
```

<Callout type='info'>
  This command requires an API key. Get one on the
  [platform](https://generaltranslation.com/dashboard).
</Callout>

## Overview

The `gtx-cli save-local` command saves any local edits you've made to translation files back to the General Translation platform. It does this by:

1. Reading your configured files from `gt.config.json`
2. Resolving the current git branch information
3. Comparing your local translation files against the latest downloaded server versions
4. Computing diffs for any changes you've made
5. Submitting those diffs to the General Translation platform

This command **does not enqueue any new translations**. It only syncs your local edits back to the platform.

<Callout type='info'>
  This is useful when you or your team has manually edited translation files
  locally and you want those changes reflected on the platform. For example, if
  a translator has made corrections directly in JSON files.
</Callout>

## How it works

The CLI tracks which translations have been downloaded in a lock file. When you run `save-local`, it:

1. Identifies files that have changed since the last download by comparing content hashes
2. Fetches the original server content for those files
3. Generates unified diffs between the server version and your local version
4. Submits the diffs to the platform

Only files that have actually changed will be processed.

## Flags

| Parameter      | Description                     | Type     | Optional | Default            |
| -------------- | ------------------------------- | -------- | -------- | ------------------ |
| `--api-key`    | API key for General Translation | `string` | `true`   |                    |
| `--project-id` | General Translation project ID  | `string` | `true`   |                    |
| `-c, --config` | Path to the GT config file      | `string` | `true`   | `"gt.config.json"` |

All of these parameters are optional if you have them configured via environment variables or in your `gt.config.json`.

<Callout type='warn'>
  Do not add your API key to the `gt.config.json` file! You should set it as an
  environment variable instead. The CLI will automatically read `GT_API_KEY` if
  it is set.
</Callout>
