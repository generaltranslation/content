### Do I need an API key to use the CLI?

The [`translate`](/docs/cli/translate) command requires a production API key, which you can get for free at [generaltranslation.com](https://generaltranslation.com). The [`init`](/docs/cli/init) command can generate one for you during setup.

### When should I run `gtx-cli translate`?

Run it in your CI/CD pipeline **before** building your app for production. It should not be used during development — in development, use development API keys for on-demand translation instead.

### Can I use the CLI with libraries other than gt-next and gt-react?

Yes. The CLI can generate translations for third-party i18n libraries like [next-intl](https://next-intl.dev/) and [i18next](https://react.i18next.com/). It can also translate standalone JSON, Markdown, MDX, JS, and TS files.

### What file formats does the CLI support?

The CLI supports [JSON](/docs/cli/formats/json), [MDX](/docs/cli/formats/mdx), [HTML](/docs/cli/formats/html), [TypeScript/JavaScript](/docs/cli/formats/ts), [plain text](/docs/cli/formats/txt), and [GT's internal format](/docs/cli/formats/gt).

### Where do the translations go?

Depending on your configuration, translations are either uploaded to the GT CDN or saved locally in your project bundle. See [`save-local`](/docs/cli/save-local) for details on storing translations locally.
