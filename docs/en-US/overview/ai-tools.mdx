description: Resources for AI coding tools including llms.txt and an MCP server
---

We provide several resources to help your AI tools work with General Translation.

## llms.txt

### llms.txt

Provide your AI coding tools with our [llms.txt](/llms.txt) file for a brief summary of our docs in an LLM-friendly format.

### llms-full.txt

Provide your AI coding tools with our [llms-full.txt](/llms-full.txt) file for the full content of our docs in an LLM-friendly format.

## MCP server

We offer a simple MCP server that AI tools like Cursor, Windsurf, and Claude Code can use to access our docs.

### Configuring the MCP server

#### Local MCP server

For AI tools which maintain a persistent connection such as **Windsurf**, **Cursor**, and **Claude Code**, you can run our MCP docs server locally.

```json title="mcp.json" copy
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "generaltranslation": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@generaltranslation/mcp@latest"]
    }
  }
}
```

#### Streamable-HTTP MCP

Otherwise, you can use our MCP server hosted at `https://mcp.gtx.dev`.

```json title=".mcp.json"
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "generaltranslation": {
      "type": "streamable-http",
      "url": "https://mcp.gtx.dev"
    }
  }
}
```

#### SSE MCP

For tools that don't support streamable-http, you can use the SSE endpoint instead.

```json title=".mcp.json"
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "generaltranslation": {
      "type": "sse",
      "url": "https://mcp.gtx.dev/sse"
    }
  }
}
```

### Using the MCP server

#### Cursor

To use the MCP server in Cursor, simply ask the AI to use the `generaltranslation` tool.

For example, you can ask the AI: "Use the generaltranslation tool to explain how to use a `<T>` component."

#### Windsurf

To use the MCP server in Windsurf, ask the AI to use the `generaltranslation` mcp server.

For example, you can ask the AI: "Use the generaltranslation mcp server to explain how to use a `<T>` component."

#### Claude Code

To use the MCP server in Claude Code, ask the AI to use the `generaltranslation` mcp server.
