General Translation offers the following tools for all of your i18n needs:

- Open-source developer libraries for React, Next.js, React Native, and more

- An AI agent that keeps your code continuously internationalized and content updated

Each of these tools can be used standalone or mixed and matched to fit your needs.

To use the open-source libraries with your own translation provider, please see our standalone docs for [gt-next](/docs/next/concepts/stand-alone) and [gt-react](/docs/react/concepts/stand-alone).

To use General Translation's AI translation service to translate your JSON, Markdown, or MDX files, please see our [CLI tool](/docs/cli) docs.

To use General Translation's AI agent to keep your code continuously internationalized and content updated, please see our docs on [Locadex](/docs/locadex).

## Features

### ⚛️ Translate entire React components in-line

- A single opening and closing `<T>` component is all you need to translate an entire React component.
  - No need for complex refactoring or messy function calls.
- Content is in-line and in the same location as your code.
  - No keys, strings, or additional files are needed!
- The library manages all i18n logic behind the scenes, so you don't have to.
- Translations are always kept in sync with your source code.
- Translations contain contextual information about the content, so they are more accurate.

```jsx title="Page.jsx" copy
export default function Page() {
  return (
    // [!code highlight]
    <T>
      <p>You can write any JSX as children of the {'<T>'} component.</p>
      <p>
        For example, you could write a <a href='/'>link</a> and have the text be
        translated in context.
      </p>
      <div>
        <div>
          <p>Even deeply nested components are translated in context.</p>
          <button>Click me!</button>
        </div>
      </div>
    </T> // [!code highlight]
  );
}
```

### 🔎 Feature parity with existing libraries

- GT libraries also support the same features as existing libraries like `i18next`, `react-intl`, and `next-intl`.
- Features such as dictionaries, plurals, currencies, and automatic routing are all supported.

### 🧠 AI-powered translation service

- Our AI-powered translation service allows you to create translations for your content in seconds.
- **Translation hot reload** will automatically update your translations as you write them.
- All content is re-arranged and customized according to the language.
- Supports all major content types, including React, JSON, HTML, Markdown, and MDX.

### 🔧 Developer-friendly

- Setup is simple and can be done in minutes.
- All GT libraries are open-source and work standalone.
  - You can use your own translation provider or use our AI-powered translation service.
- No more wasting time managing translation keys like `t('menu.header.title')`.
  - Just write everything in-line!

### 🤖 AI Agent

- Our AI agent Locadex keeps your code continuously internationalized and content updated.
- It integrates with your CI/CD pipeline to automatically internationalize and translate your content as they are pushed to your repository.
- No need to worry about internationalization or translation work -- Locadex handles it all for you.
