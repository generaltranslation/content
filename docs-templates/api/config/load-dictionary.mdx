title: loadDictionary
description: API reference for the loadDictionary() function
---

## Overview

`loadDictionary` will load a translation json file for a given locale.

This function is intended for those who which to use `__PACKAGE_NAME__` as a stand-alone i18n library.

This function is primarily used to migrate existing projects with i18n to General Translation while keeping their existing translations.


If multiple translations exist, translations from dictionaries loaded by `loadDictionary` will always take precedence over others.
`loadDictionary` only supports the use of JSON files with string translations.


## Reference

### Parameters
<TypeTable
  type={{
    "locale": {
        type: 'string',
        optional: false,
    },
  }}
/>

### Description
| Type | Description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| `locale` | The locale for which translations should be loaded. |

### Returns

A `Promise<any>` that resolves to dictionary mapping ids to translations for the given locale.

---

## Setup

Generally, you will load the dictionary from the `./public/locales` directory.

Define your `loadDictionary` in a file.
Make sure to have the function return a promise that resolves to an object with translations for the given locale.

```jsx title="src/loadDictionary.js"
export default async function loadDictionary(locale) {
  const translations = await import(`../public/locales/${locale}.json`);
  return translations.default;
}
```

Then pass it to your `<GTProvider>` component:

```jsx title="src/App.js"
import { GTProvider } from '__PACKAGE_NAME__';
import loadDictionary from './loadDictionary';

<GTProvider loadDictionary={loadDictionary}>
  <App />
</GTProvider>
```

  **Question:** What's the difference between [`loadTranslations`](__DOCS_PATH__/api/config/load-translations) and [`loadDictionary`](__DOCS_PATH__/api/config/load-dictionary)?

  * [`loadTranslations`](__DOCS_PATH__/api/config/load-translations) is used to define custom loading behavior for fetching translations for your app.
  This could be getting translations from a CDN, a database, or your app's bundle.
  These are usually machine generated translations, managed by the cli tool, and not very user friendly to edit.
  * [`loadDictionary`](__DOCS_PATH__/api/config/load-dictionary) is intended for implementations of `__PACKAGE_NAME__` as a standalone library.
  Users bring their own translations and no translation infrastructure is used.

## Notes
 * `loadDictionary` is used to load custom translations for your app.
 * Dictionaries loaded by `loadDictionary` will take precedence over translations loaded by [`loadTranslations`](__DOCS_PATH__/api/config/load-translations).
