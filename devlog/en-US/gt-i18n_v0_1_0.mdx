## Overview

While our packages have traditionally focused on web development environments, the release of `gt-i18n@0.1.0` represents a foundational step toward framework-agnostic JS internationalization.

We believe this need requires a new library for two reasons: (1) the unique concerns of an opinionated library should be localized to a distinct package and (2) it creates a platform to separate pure-JS logic from framework-specific logic.
Though `generaltranslation` is also a runtime-agnostic library, it is—by design—not suitable for this purpose as it is meant to serve as an unopinionated base layer for supporting i18n functionality.

## Looking Forward

This library is still very much in its infancy, but expect to see more string-related i18n functionality in the future.
