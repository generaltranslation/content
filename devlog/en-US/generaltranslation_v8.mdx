## Overview

In **generaltranslation v8**, we're making significant changes to our API, and are deprecating some API functions and endpoints.

**<u>Older versions of the API will no longer be supported.</u>**

`generaltranslation` versions prior to `7.5` will likely result in errors.
`gtx-cli` versions prior to `2.1.5` will likely result in errors.

---

## Motivation

To improve the developer experience, facilitate future development, and make it easier to manage translations, we're introducing branching and deprecating some API endpoints that were no longer used.

---

## Features

The newest API functions support branching, which allows you to create different translations for different branches of your project.

Every file is now associated with a branch. File versioning is now determined by `branchId`, `fileId`, and `versionId`.

Previously, file translations were associated with a single branch.
Cached file translations defaulted to using the most recently updated version of the file.

In version 8, updating a file's translations will now use the latest version of the file on the specified branch.
Versioning is tied to a branch's history, instead of timestamp.

The new versioning system mirrors git's branching model:

- Updating a source file on a branch will create a new version of the file.
- Merging a branch into main will generate a link between the source file on the main branch and the source file on the merged branch.
  - Future translations will incorporate translations from both branches.
- Checking out a branch will create a new version of the file
  - Translations on this branch will reference previous translations from the main branch.

To enable this feature, add the `--enable-branching` flag to the `gtx-cli translate` command on the latest version of gtx-cli.

By default, branching is disabled and all project files are associated with the main branch.

To use this feature, your org must be on a paid plan.

## Changes

- Deprecated `enqueueEntries`
- Modified params of `enqueueFiles` (added branchIds)
- Deprecated `fetchTranslations`
- Deprecated `shouldSetupProject`
- Modified params of `submitUserEditDiffs` (added branchIds, made id fields required)

### `gtx-cli`

- Added `--enable-branching` flag to `translate` command
