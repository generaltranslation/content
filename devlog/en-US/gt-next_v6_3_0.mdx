## Overview

In **gt-next 6.3.0**, we're moving closer to a library that is suitable for both human developers and AI developers. Our guiding principle for this release was to **minimize disruption to existing code** while still introducing the essential functionality required for i18n.

To achieve this, we introduce a new `msg()` function for translating strings anywhere in your codebase. Previously, developers had to pass the `gt()` function from `useGT()` or `getGT()` up the call stack in order to translate a string. With `msg()`, you simply wrap the string once, and then pass it through `m()` at render time.

## A comparison

Historically, strings had to be wrapped by passing the `gt()` function through multiple layers:

```tsx title="constants.tsx"
export const greeting1 = 'Hello, world!'
export const getGreeting2 = (gt: any) => gt('Hello, world!')
```

```tsx title="Page.tsx"
import { greeting1, getGreeting2 } from './constants'

export default function Page() {
  const gt = useGT()
  return (
    <div>
      {greeting1}
      {getGreeting2(gt)}
    </div>
  )
}
```

Now, with `msg()`, strings can be declared directly as constants. The only requirement is that you pass them through `m()` (from `useMessages()` or `getMessages()`) when displaying.

```tsx title="constants.tsx"
export const greeting1 = 'Hello, world!'
export const greeting2 = msg('Hello, world!')
```

```tsx title="Page.tsx"
import { greeting1, greeting2 } from './constants'

export default function Page() {
  const m = useMessages()
  return (
    <div>
      {greeting1}
      {m(greeting2)}
    </div>
  )
}
```

## Encoding and decoding

To support interpolation, the `msg()` function returns an encoded message instead of a plain string. The format looks like this:

```text
<interpolated content>:<base64 encoded string>
```

The base64-encoded portion contains a JSON object with:

- `$_hash`: Hash of the original string
- `$_source`: Parameters interpolated into the message
- `$id`: A custom unique identifier (if provided)
- `$context`: Context of the message (if specified)
- Any variables included in the interpolation

This design slightly changes how strings compare directly but ensures minimal impact on typing and code structure. To access the interpolated content, use `decodeMsg()`.

### Why an encoded string?

The alternative to using an encoded string would mean that `msg()` would have to return a custom object type containing the additional metadata. While this works for the encode/decode paradigm, it introduces issues when dealing with strict typing.

We concluded that the best way to minimize the impact of i18n in this scenario would simply be to return a string which contains the metadata, instead.

### Example

Original code without i18n:

```ts title="original.ts"
const name = 'John'
const message = `Hello, ${name}!`

if (message.length > 10) {
  console.log('The message is too long')
} else {
  console.log('The message is just the right length')
}
```

With `msg()` and `decodeMsg()`:

```ts title="internationalized.ts"
import { msg, decodeMsg } from 'gt-next'

const name = 'John'
const message = msg('Hello, {name}!', { name })

if (decodeMsg(message).length > 10) {
  console.log('The message is too long')
} else {
  console.log('The message is just the right length')
}
```

## Other

You can also override parameters within the `gt()` function, even if they were already interpolated when calling `msg()`.

```tsx title="Page.tsx"
import { msg, useMessages } from 'gt-next'

const message = msg('Hello, {name}!', { name: 'John' })

export default function Page() {
  const m = useMessages()
  return <div>{m(message, { name: 'Jane' })}</div> // This will return "Hello, Jane!"
}
```

## Summary

This release focuses on making `gt-next` more developer-friendly while minimizing the overhead of i18n. By eliminating the need to pass the `gt()` function through the call stack, the new `msg()` function provides a cleaner, more intuitive way to translate strings and greatly simplifies the i18n process.
