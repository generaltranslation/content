## Overview

We often find that the more mature a codebase is, the more content is fragmented.
Sentences become scattered between functions, utilities, logic, and services.

```tsx
function getSubject(gender) { 
  return gender === "male" ? "boy" : "girl" 
}
function getObject(toy, gender) { 
  return toy === "ball" ? "ball" : getSubject(gender)
}

function Component({ gender, toy }) {
  return (
    <>
      <p>
        The beautiful {getSubject(gender)} plays with the {getObject(toy, gender)}.
      </p>
    </>
  )
}
```

When it inevitably comes time to internationalize, developers find that they have painted themselves into a corner.
Enforcing things like agreement, conjugation, and changes to word order across multiple files is not manageable without a major refactor.
Traditionally, this meant manually extracting every possible permutation of each sentence and adding them to a translation dictionary.


In **gt-next 6.8.0**, we are doubling down on the belief that a strong i18n library adapts to a codebase, rather than the other way around.
While `gt-next` already translates content inline, it lacks two fundamental features of such a library:
(1) Support for sentence fragmentation and (2) reusable content while also preserving word agreement, conjugation, or word order changes.

We are introducing the `<Static>` component to allow static function calls directly inside translations.

```tsx
function getSubject(gender) { 
  return gender === "male" ? "boy" : "girl" 
}
function getObject(type, gender) { 
  return type === "ball" ? "ball" : getSubject(gender)
}

function Component({ gender, toy }) {
  return (
    <T>
      <p>
        The beautiful <Static>{getSubject(gender)}</Static> plays with the <Static>{getObject(toy, gender)}</Static>.
      </p>
    </T>
  )
}
```

## Important Considerations

That being said, we strongly emphasize using the `<Static>` component carefully and judiciously.
The `<Static>` component, while powerful, can also lead to major increases in the number of translation entries.
If used incorrectly, this could have negative effects on load times for an application.

## How to use `<Static>`

Just like the `<T>` and `<Var>` components, the `<Static>` component is a flag that tells the CLI tool where to and where not to look for translatable content.
It tells the CLI tool to dereference a function call inside the `<Static>` tags and catalog all possible content being returned by that function.
Treat every return statement as if it had a `<T>` component wrapping it.

Once the CLI tool has found all possible outputs from a function call, it creates a separate translation entry for each possible output.
For example, the following code creates two separate translation entries: "The boy is beautiful" and "The girl is beautiful".
Because a different translation entry exists for each possible output, we can support agreement, conjugation, and word order in a fragmented sentence: "*El* niño es *hermoso*" and "*La* niña es *hermosa*".
```tsx
function getSubject(gender) { 
  return gender === "male" ? "boy" : "girl" 
}
function Component({ gender }) {
  return (
    <T>
      The <Static>{getSubject(gender)}</Static> is beautiful.
    </T>
  )
}
```

## Limitations and Future Improvements

### Multiplication

As mentioned earlier, the `<Static>` component, if used too liberally, can generate a large number of translation entries which could have a negative performance impact on load times.
For example, consider a component with two `<Static>` components, each wrapping a function invocation with two possible outcomes.
In this case, four translation entries are created.
**Every additional `<Static>` component multiplies the number of translations by the number of possible outcomes from each function call.**
```tsx
function getSubject(gender) { 
  return gender === "male" ? "boy" : "girl" 
}
function getObject(toy) { 
  return toy === "ball" ? "ball" : "crayon"
}
function Component({ gender, toy }) {
  return (
    <T>
      <Static>{getSubject(gender)}</Static> plays with the <Static>{getObject(toy)}</Static>.
    </T>
  )
}
```

### Syntax

It is important to treat every return statement as if it had a `<T>` component wrapping it.
Any variables or function calls that are dynamic must still be wrapped in `<Var>` components.

Currently, `<Static>` only supports function calls as children, but in the future it will be able to support more complex expressions.
As of `gt-next 6.8.0`, the following syntax is supported for static functions:
```tsx
function getExamples(key) {
  switch (key) {
    case "string, number, and boolean literals":
      if (condition1) {
        return "The boy"
      } else if (condition2) {
        return 22
      } else {
        return true
      }
    case "jsx expressions":
      return (
        <>
          Hello, <Static>{getTitle(title)}</Static>. How are you, <Var>{name}</Var>?
        </>
      );
    case "ternary operators":
      return condition ? "The boy" : "The girl"      
    case "function calls":
      return otherStaticFunction();
  }
}
```


## Conclusion

**`gt-next 6.8.0`** introduces the `<Static>` component as a solution to sentence fragmentation without sacrificing translation coverage or proper grammatical agreement.
